# Rebrand-Blizzard-App

Changes the Blizzard App icons back to Battle.net icons.

Usage
=====

1. Download and extract next to current Blizzard/Battle.net install. This needs to be in the latest App directory and not the base Battle.net install.
    For Example: You should extract everything into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net\Battle.net.8554" (or wherever you have Bnet installed), not the parent directory of just "C:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net"
